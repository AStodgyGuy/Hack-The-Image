# Hack-The-Image developed at Hack The Bubble, St Andrews

The idea behind this application is to encrypt a message and embed that encrypted message into a photo using steganography. 

Once the image has been steganographed, send it to another user for them to see the image and view amd decrypt the hidden message.
